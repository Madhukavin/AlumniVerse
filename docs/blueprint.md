- Primary color: Dark Slate Gray (#2F4F4F) to convey sophistication and stability in a dark theme.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#333333) to provide a comfortable dark backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight important interactive elements against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, should be used for body and headline to keep a modern look, with a slightly increased font weight for better readability.
- Simple, geometric icons should be used for navigation and key features, with a light color to ensure visibility against the dark background.
- Use a card-based layout to present alumni profiles and event information clearly, with a slightly elevated card background color for contrast.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects for a smooth user experience, with careful consideration of contrast and visibility in the dark theme.
